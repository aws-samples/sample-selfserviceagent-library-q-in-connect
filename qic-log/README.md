# AWS Wisdom Assistant CloudWatch Logging

This CloudFormation template sets up comprehensive logging for AWS Wisdom Assistant using CloudWatch Logs delivery.

## Overview

The template creates a complete logging infrastructure that captures AWS Wisdom Assistant events and stores them in CloudWatch Logs for monitoring, debugging, and analytics.

## Resources Created

- **CloudWatch Log Group**: Stores assistant event logs with configurable retention
- **Log Delivery Source**: Captures events from the Wisdom Assistant
- **Log Delivery Destination**: Routes logs to CloudWatch
- **Log Delivery**: Connects source to destination

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default | Required |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `AiAssistantARN` | ARN of your AWS Wisdom Assistant | - | Yes |
| `LogRetentionDays` | Number of days to retain logs | 30 | No |

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Existing AWS Wisdom Assistant
- Wisdom Assistant ARN 
  ```bash
  # List all assistants
  aws qconnect list-assistants
  ```

### Deploy via Console
1. Open AWS CloudFormation Console
2. Create new stack
3. Upload `qic-assistant-cloudwatch-log.yaml`
4. Provide your Wisdom Assistant ARN
5. Deploy

## Outputs

- `LogGroupName`: CloudWatch Log Group name
- `LogGroupArn`: CloudWatch Log Group ARN
- `TemplateVersion`: Template version (v0.1)

## Log Format

Logs are stored in JSON format containing assistant interaction events, queries, and responses.

## Permissions Required

The deployment requires permissions for:
- `logs:CreateLogGroup`
- `logs:CreateDeliverySource`
- `logs:CreateDeliveryDestination`
- `logs:CreateDelivery`

## Cost Considerations

Costs depend on:
- Log volume generated by assistant usage
- Retention period selected
- CloudWatch Logs pricing in your region

## Cleanup

Delete the CloudFormation stack to remove all resources:
```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name wisdom-assistant-logging
```
